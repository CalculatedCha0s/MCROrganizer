# Multiple Challenge Run Organizer - MCRO

Currently being developed by one person - that's me :) - using C# WPF. Below you'll have a short description of the tool, its use and some planned features.
- MCRO is being primarily designed for challenge runners that stream their misfortune to a live audience.
- MCRO was designed to be captured in OBS and placed above existing splits.
- MCRO is meant to ease the organization of multiple games that need to be completed in order to complete a run.
- Streamers usually do this by having some photoshop templates that they edit everytime they complete a game (no-hit runners especially, as speedrunners do not bother with this because it is tedious and they just tend to plop every split into a huge list and it looks terrible).
- MCRO represents each game by using rectangular shapes - I do understand that maybe some people might like triangles or other funny shapes... well, tough luck.
- The tool will also contain features such as:
    - Simple tool => simple interface - no buttons or unnecessary dialogs, edit everything in one window.
    - Basic functionalities such as adding, deleting, editing a run (its name so far) - implemented.
    - Setting the added runs in a preferred position simply by dragging and dropping the run - implemented.
    - Dynamically updated runs (like the spacing between the runs and their width) - future implementation.
    - Loading and saving templates with runs that are meant to be completed (so that the user does not create the runs everytime the program is booted) - future implementation.
    - Shortcuts for ease of use (go to next run, go to previous run) - future implementation.
    - Randomize the order of the runs - future implementation.
    - Color customization for the state of the runs, fonts, font size, font weight and other cosmetic stuff - future implementation.
    - TBA.
